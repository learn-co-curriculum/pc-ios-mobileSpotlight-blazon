# Mobile Spotlight!

##Blazon 

Blazon was created to help document and deter street harrassment.  Every day, women, people of color, and other minority groups face harrassment, verbal abuse, or threats or even acts oh physical violence, simply because of who they are.

The team at Blazon leveraged mobile technology in order to track these incidents, develop information on where and how they are taking place, and give victims the opportunity to get help in real time.

The Blazon team is in talks with universities, city governments, and other constituencies, about using their technology so communities can better understand patterns of harrassment and keep people safe.

Blazon is truly an example of using mobile technology to create a better world.
